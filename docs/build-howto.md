# Compiling with Libproxy

The current stable API provides a small synchronous function set which makes it easy to add it to existing application and libraries.

The following example is written in C but can be translated as well to every other programming language thanks to gobject-introspection. Furthermore there are
several language samples provided in 'docs/samples' and also linked here in this main documentation.

## Initialization

First of all libproxy needs to be initialized. This is done with:

```
/**
 * px_proxy_factory_new:
 *
 * Creates a new pxProxyFactory instance. This instance should be kept
 * around as long as possible as it contains cached data to increase
 * performance.  Memory usage should be minimal (cache is small) and the
 * cache lifespan is handled automatically.
 *
 * @return A new pxProxyFactory instance or NULL on error
 */
pxProxyFactory *px_proxy_factory_new (void);
```

## Get proxy information

Determining whether a proxy server is need to access a given url use `px_proxy_factory_get_proxies`:

```
/**
 * px_proxy_factory_get_proxies:
 * @self: a #pxProxyFactpry
 * @url: Get proxxies for specificed URL
 *
 * Get which proxies to use for the specified URL.
 *
 * A NULL-terminated array of proxy strings is returned.
 * If the first proxy fails, the second should be tried, etc...
 * Don't forget to free the strings/array when you are done.
 * If an unrecoverable error occurs, this function returns NULL.
 *
 * Regarding performance: this method always blocks and may be called
 * in a separate thread (is thread-safe).  In most cases, the time
 * required to complete this function call is simply the time required
 * to read the configuration (i.e. from gconf, kconfig, etc).
 *
 * In the case of PAC, if no valid PAC is found in the cache (i.e.
 * configuration has changed, cache is invalid, etc), the PAC file is
 * downloaded and inserted into the cache. This is the most expensive
 * operation as the PAC is retrieved over the network. Once a PAC exists
 * in the cache, it is merely a javascript invocation to evaluate the PAC.
 * One should note that DNS can be called from within a PAC during
 * javascript invocation.
 *
 * In the case of WPAD, WPAD is used to automatically locate a PAC on the
 * network.  Currently, we only use DNS for this, but other methods may
 * be implemented in the future.  Once the PAC is located, normal PAC
 * performance (described above) applies.
 *
 * The format of the returned proxy strings are as follows:
 *   - http://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *   - socks://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *   - socks5://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *   - socks4://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *   - <procotol>://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *   - direct://
 * Please note that the username and password in the above URLs are optional
 * and should be use to authenticate the connection if present.
 *
 * For SOCKS proxies, when the protocol version is specified (socks4:// or
 * socks5://), it is expected that only this version is used. When only
 * socks:// is set, the client MUST try SOCKS version 5 protocol and, on
 * connection failure, fallback to SOCKS version 4.
 *
 * Other proxying protocols may exist. It is expected that the returned
 * configuration scheme shall match the network service name of the
 * proxy protocol or the service name of the protocol being proxied if the
 * previous does not exist. As an example, on Mac OS X you can configure a
 * RTSP streaming proxy. The expected returned configuration would be:
 *   - rtsp://[username:password@]proxy:port
 *
 * To free the returned value, call px_proxy_factory_free_proxies.
 *
 * @url The URL we are trying to reach
 * @return A NULL-terminated array of proxy strings to use
 */
char **px_proxy_factory_get_proxies (pxProxyFactory *self, const char *url);
```

## Freeing proxy list

Ensure unused proxy information is freed after user with `px_proxy_factory_free_proxies`:

```
/**
 * px_proxy_factory_free_proxies
 * @proxies: proxie array
 *
 * Frees the proxy array returned by px_proxy_factory_get_proxies when no
 * longer used.
 *
 * @since 0.4.16
 */
void px_proxy_factory_free_proxies (char **proxies);
```

## Destruction

To close and destroy the `pxProxyFactory` make use of:

```
/**
 * px_proxy_factory_free:
 * @self: a #pxProxyFactory
 *
 * Frees the pxProxyFactory instance when no longer used.
 */
void px_proxy_factory_free (pxProxyFactory *self);
```
